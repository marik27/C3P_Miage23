.mw##### Week 6

# Ikimath Adeoye

Last week, I practiced double dispatch by doing the rock paper scissors exercise and watching videos  and taking quizzes on fun mooc.

Regarding my kata "Remove Nil Checks", I reviewed the "Avoid Null Checks" video, which helped me understand the concept of my Kata. Although I'm currently behind the initial schedule due to personal problems and organization issues, I'm on track to catch up by next week.


# Ouassila Boukhars

I have seriously begun working on the project. After reviewing the code, I realized that it was incorrect, so I started writing tests for the pawn's initial one-step and double-step movements. The goal is to implement and debug the pawn movement. I will also write tests for the following features: capture Moves (test if pawns can capture an opponent's piece diagonally), En Passant (implement and test the complex "en passant" move) and blocked Move (ensure that pawns cannot move forward if another piece blocks their path).
