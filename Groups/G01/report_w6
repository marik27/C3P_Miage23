##### Week 6

# Ikimath Adeoye

Last week, I practiced double dispatch by doing the rock paper scissors exercise and watching videos  and taking quizzes on fun mooc.

Regarding my kata "Remove Nil Checks", I reviewed the "Avoid Null Checks" video, which helped me understand the concept of my Kata. Although I'm currently behind the initial schedule due to personal problems and organization issues, I'm on track to catch up by next week.
